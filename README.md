# Automation

In this repository you can find automation test samples for two of the websites that I tested duing my QA course: eMag.ro and libris.ro. The technologies that I used are **WebdriverIO** and **NPM**.

For **eMag.ro**, I created test cases to check the following:
- the website is loading
- the search box is working properly
- it contains a cart button
- the logo appears on the homepage
- open 'Resigilate' page
- open 'eMAG Help' page

For **libris.ro** I tested the following:
- login with correct credentials
- login with incorrect credentials
- 'Add to favorites' button and check if the item was added to the list
